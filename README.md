## Purpose of this repository

This repository provides a **transparent record of the code and derived datasets** used to produce the Results figures and tables in the associated MSc dissertation.

The dissertation itself is the primary research output.  
This repository exists to document the analytical workflow and to allow **optional reproduction of figures**, not to serve as a standalone software package.

## What this repository contains

### Code
- R scripts used for literature retrieval and deterministic abstract screening
- Python script used to generate descriptive figures and tables reported in the Results section

### Data
- **Derived, author-coded datasets only**
- Study-level dataset for the locus-resolved analytic subset (n = 33)
- Gene-level extraction table used for frequency counts and visualisations

### Not included
- Abstract text
- Full-text articles
- Publisher-protected material
- Working or exploratory Excel spreadsheets

Working spreadsheets used during manual coding and quality control were treated as intermediate tools and are not redistributed.

## Relationship to the dissertation

All figures and tables generated by the Python analysis script correspond directly to figures presented in the dissertation Results section.

The analysis code does not introduce new findings beyond those reported in the dissertation.  
It reproduces the descriptive summaries already discussed in the text.

---

## Optional figure reproduction

The code in this repository **does not need to be run** to understand or assess the dissertation.

However, for transparency and reproducibility, the Results figures can be regenerated using the provided scripts and datasets.
