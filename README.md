## Overview

This repository contains the code and derived datasets used in an MSc dissertation examining the published evidence linking **archaic hominin introgression**, primarily from Neanderthals, to **neurobehavioural, psychiatric, cognitive, circadian, pain-related, and brain-related traits** in modern humans.

The project is a **systematic, literature-based evidence synthesis**. It does not generate new genetic data. Instead, it retrieves, screens, and organises existing studies in order to assess:

- how frequently introgressed loci are linked to neurobehavioural traits,
- the **biological resolution** at which such claims are reported (genome-wide, region, gene, variant),
- and the interpretability of these claims from an archaeological perspective.

Computational tools are used to manage scale, enforce reproducibility, and support transparent descriptive analysis.
